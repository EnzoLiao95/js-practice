This is my [JavaScript Coding Practice](https://github.com/EnzoLiao95/js-practice/) repository. The basic coding language is `JavaScript` and the fontface in my simple favicon is `Verdana` (Take a look at this favicon on the left). The `JavaScript` files in this repository are not libraries, which means that it is really difficult to use functions in these files to draw other layouts. To simplify the usage, files in this repository make up a web folder (of course no server built) and you can view my simple works by opening any HTML file. Now only **force-directed graph** and **stream graph** files are uploaded. When a new work is done, it will be uploaded to this repository soon.

## View

Download all files here (.zip) and open any HTML file. Files in `css/` is the basic style of webpages. The folder called `img/` include favicons (.svg & .png) and other logos.
